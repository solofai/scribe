# Communication Profile: Lori (Public Example)

**Profile Owner:** Lori (public example baseline)
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-19 (2)
**Sessions Analyzed:** 20+

## Idea Structure
- Thinks in interconnected webs - almost every idea touches 2-3 existing concepts
- Buries the key insight partway through a ramble; look for the transition from problem description to "so what would be useful is..." or "the idea is..."
- Frequently generates multiple distinct topics in a single dictation dump
- Connects abstract ideas to concrete implementation quickly ("and this could be a skill that...")
- Often circles back to earlier points with new context or refinement

## Priority Signals
| Signal | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Excitement, detailed elaboration, connecting to multiple concepts | High priority - core to the project vision |
| "probably not worth exploring", "just a thought", hedging | Low priority - still capture, but mark as low-priority |
| "I like how you're doing X", "let's make sure this is embedded" | Meta-feedback about process - act on it, do not create a note |
| "before you do that..." or "wait, related to that..." | Tangent incoming - may be merge candidate or new note |
| Explicit scope statements ("this is domain-agnostic", "keep X separate") | Governance - take seriously, these are architectural decisions |

## Style Preferences
- Brief over verbose - values concise, structured output
- Actionable over theoretical - next steps should be concrete checkboxes, not vague suggestions
- Dual-purpose - output should be useful for human browsing AND for AI context retrieval
- Cross-referenced - always link to related existing notes and project files
- Preserves raw dictation - values having the original text for reference, even after distillation

## Common Behaviors
- Goes on tangents that are often genuinely productive (BFS brainstorming pattern)
- Self-aware about tangents - sometimes explicitly flags them ("I know I'm going off on a rabbit hole")
- Values the dictation system as both a note-taking tool and a personal reflection tool
- Wants tools to be generalizable - thinks about whether a colleague could use the same system
- Frequently asks "can we embed this into the skill?" - iteratively improves the tooling itself
- Reading triggers idea flooding - reading a single paragraph can spawn 5+ ideas across multiple topics. Dictation serves as a cognitive offloading mechanism: capture the ideas immediately so the brain can let go and refocus on reading. Expect bursts of multiple dictations in quick succession when reading analytical content.
- Alternates between meta-reflection (observing own thinking patterns) and concrete ideas - both are valuable; meta-observations often lead to tool/skill improvements

## Candidate Patterns (Need More Evidence)
- _None currently._

## Runtime Adaptation Notes
- This file is a public seed example.
- Runtime personalization should be written to `~/.scribe/user-profile.md`.
- Keep this file stable unless intentionally improving the public example.
